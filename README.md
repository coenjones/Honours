# Honours
Publicly accessible collection of code, docs and figures from my Honours thesis on Hierarchical Bradley-Terry Models


Dependencies - ggplot2 and matlib

Run source('module.r') in R to import all the available functionality. The examples folder includes a number of interesting examples with reference to the data found in Data

A video summarising some of the functionality can be found at https://youtu.be/WcByZP34Gg8

Thesis.pdf contains the document for which this package was designed, but a more concise vignette and documentation file for the codebase alone does not yet exist. Chapter 3 of this document does enclose most of the information required for using the package alone, whilst Chapter 2 introduces the mathematical formulations of each of the models that have been implemented. The code for the examples shown in Chapter 4 can also be found under AFL.R and NBA_example.R in the Examples folder.
